# Student_Performance_score
I have used Simple Linear Regression.
Equation for linear regression is y = mx + c. y is dependent variable and x is independent variable. In csv file we have two features hours and score. hours is x and score is y. Acccoreding to the model created, if a student study for 9.25 hrs/day he/she will score 92%. R2 score tells how much data is represented by the model.
